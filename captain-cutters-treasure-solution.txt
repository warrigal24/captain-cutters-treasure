Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. You should also TALK TO all the characters you meet and ASK them ABOUT anything interesting, including all the other characters.

(READ NOTE) ('Return me treasure by sunset or the girl gets it. - Cutter')
MOVE FABRIC (you find a calico bag)
