# Captain Cutter's Treasure

By Garry Francis

## Background

You wake up feeling groggy. Your head hurts.

"Blimey. What happened?"

You run your fingers through your hair and feel a nasty bump on the back of your head. The last thing you remember was sweeping the floor in the pub before the early morning patrons started arriving. You look around.

"What the hell am I doing in the broom closet?"

This is a traditional text adventure that was written for [PunyJam #1](https://itch.io/jam/punyjam1), 9 April to 3 May 2021.

## Release notes

Release 1 was compiled with Inform 6 version 6.34 and the PunyInform library version 2.4. You may need to make changes if using later versions.
